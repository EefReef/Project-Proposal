"Entity 1: Which short hop tournament it was"
  -"Currently the number is up to ShortHop 91, and I haven't looked to see if I'll be able to get information on the earlier ones. I know for sure I can go back to 75 though"
"Entity 2: Who won the tournament"
  -"Pretty self explanitory. Which player won the tournament. At first, I will only add the winners of the tournament"
"Entity 3: Which character did the winner play"
  -"This one might be a bit rough, the winner could play multiple characters throughout the tournament. There are graphic designs for each tournament, showing which character won the final match"
"As of starting, that will be all I am adding. Once I get the ball rolling though, I plan on adding the Top 8 of the tournament, each player's main characters, basically everything you need for a fighting game, except for the stages, there is no way for me to access that information"
